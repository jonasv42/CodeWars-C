## CodeWars-C

I'm learning to code and share some of my Codewars exercises here. The goal is not to share concise and beautiful code, but to show my evolution as a coder.

You will see that I use workarounds to deal with my still limited knowledge. I plan to improve gradually through these exercises and by looking at other solutions. This repository together with my repository on my work at 42, will show my development as a coder.
